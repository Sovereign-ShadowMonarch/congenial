Backend



Based on my analysis of the congenial-tree repository, the **Backend directory serves as the server-side component of a portfolio tracking application** that handles data processing, storage, and API endpoints for cryptocurrency and financial portfolio management.

## Primary Purpose

The Backend directory contains **a Python-based service that handles data processing, storage, and API endpoints** for what is described as **a comprehensive portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting, and tax reporting tool that respects your privacy** 



## Technical Architecture

The backend operates as a **Flask-based service that provides a comprehensive REST API**   for portfolio tracking and analysis. The main entry point **starts a RotkehlchenServer**   which **creates an APIServer with RestAPI functionality**  .

## Key Features

The Backend directory contains modules for handling:
- User authentication and management with secure encryption
- Blockchain integration for tracking balances and transactions
- Exchange API integration for fetching trading data
- DeFi protocol integration
- Asset price tracking
- Risk analysis and portfolio metrics
- Accounting and tax reporting functionality

The API is accessible at `http://localhost:5042/api/1/` when running, providing the data layer that the Frontend component consumes to display the user interface.
