## Problem Definition

<!-- Provide a description of what is the current problem and why you are raising this issue.
If it's a bug please describe what was the unexpected thing that occured and what was the
expected behaviour. -->

## Logs

<!-- Before being able to provide logs you need to enable debug logging on rotki, which is off by default.
You can enable debug logging by going to the login screen of the application, and in the lower right corner 
(or upper if you have a smaller screen) of the application you will find a cog icon. To enable debug logging
press the cog icon and select the `debug` entry. Try the flow that created the problem once again.
For more information please check: https://rotki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html#bug-reporting
The debug information is stored to the `rotkehlchen.log` file. Please attach it to the
issue as it may help us find the source of the issue faster. You can find the logs location by going
to the Help menu on the top and then choosing "Logs directory" -->
